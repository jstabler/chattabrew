  <h1>Local Connections</h1>
<p>We are committed to being a part of our community. Here are some of the things we are doing to get engaged:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our Spent Grain is given to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Hoe-Hop-Valley-Farms/100001317635055" target="_blank" >Hoe Hop Valley Farms</a> for feed and composting.</li>
  <li>We also supply spent grain to the Bluff View Bakery and the Bone Appetit dog bakery, look for bread products featuring our grain.</li>
  <li>We will be participating in a number of charity events and plan our own event next year.</li>
  <li>Our private events have already raised large amounts of money for the <a href="http://chattfoodbank.org/" target="_blank">Chattanooga Area Food Bank.</a></li>
  <li>Although we can’t get our ingredients locally we do purchase our hops from <a href="http://www.hopunion.com/" target="_blank">Hop Union</a>, a collective of family owned hop farms in Washington state.</li>
  <li>We are striving to use local business for all of our needs.</li>
  <li>We will participate in the <a href="http://www.southernbrewersfestival.com/" target="_blank">17th Annual Southern Brewers Festival</a></li>
