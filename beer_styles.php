  <h1>Beer Styles</h1>

<h3>Imperial Pilsner:</h3>
<p>A heartier version of the light bodied German style pilsner, and our flagship brew. This beer is an homage to the original Chattanooga Brewing Company.<br /><strong>ABV 5.5% IBU 30</strong></p>

<h3>Hill City IPA:</h3>
<p>A classic American India Pale. Its generous caramel malt and barley notes contrast with the mix of west coast hops, resulting in an aggressive, but well balanced, beer. <br /><strong>ABV 6.3% IBU 95</strong></p>

<h3>Hill City Gold:</h3>
<p>This medium bodied American style Golden Ale has a pronounced Cascade hop
backbone, and Munich malt sweetness, making it very session-able on a hot summer day.<br /><strong>ABV 6.1% IBU 70</strong></p>

<h3>Kölsch:</h3>
<p>Made popular in the city of Köln, this light bodied German style ale goes down easy,
finishing crisp and clean with its wheat and pilsen malts and traditional hops.<br /><strong>ABV 4.7% IBU 25</strong></p>

<h3>ChickBock:</h3>
<p>A German style dark lager, medium bodied and relatively low in hops. A portion of proceeds are donated to the North Chickamauga Creek Conservancy. So lift a pint and help save the watershed!<br /><strong>ABV 6.1% IBU 35</strong></p>

<h3>Oktoberfest:</h3>
<p>Another special beer, made in limited quantities, this is our version of the traditional fall favorite, a sweet and malty lager, great for crisp fall weather drinking.<br /><strong>ABV 6.3%  IBU 25</strong></p>

<h3>Winter Warmer:</h3>
<p>A sweet malty English Festival style beer to warm your bones on a cold winter night.<br /><strong>ABV 6.2 % IBU 35</strong></p>

<h3>Hill City Stout:</h3>
<p>A craft beer version of the English classic, ours is more hoppy than most but still well balanced enough for knocking back a few.<br /><strong>ABV 6.2% IBU 50</strong></p>

<h3>Hill City Black Lager:</h3>
<p>This is one of our special beers made in limited quantities. It’s a lighter body dark beer with lots of complex malty tastes for you to enjoy on a cold winter night.  <br /><strong>ABV 5.0% IBU 45</strong></p>

<h3>Hill City Pale Ale:</h3>
<p>This one is an Americanized version of the classic English Style giving us that nice hop profile popular on this side of the pond.<br /><strong>ABV 6.1% IBU 65</strong></p>
