  <p>Chattanooga Brewing Company opened in 1890 and lasted until 1915 and was the choice of beer drinkers in Chattanooga, selling beer in most of the local taverns and in cases of bottles. Among their brands of the day were Imperial Pilsner and Magnolia. Returning to the local beer scene in 2010, they have brought back Imperial Pilsner and many other tasty brews. Many German, English, and American styles are featured throughout the year.</p>
  <p><strong>Imperial Pilsner</strong> and <strong>Hill City IPA</strong> are available all year long. Two seasonal beers are featured each season and a few special brews roll out in limited quantities throughout the year.</p>
